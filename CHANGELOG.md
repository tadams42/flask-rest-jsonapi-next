# CHANGELOG

## 0.40.0 (2023-07-21)

- removed restriction on SQLAlchemy version, library now works with SQLAlchemy 2.x
  - working with SQLAlchemy 2.x layer requires some changes in client code, otherwise
    there might be performance penalties
  - added docs section on SQLAlchemy 2.x usage
- tested with psycopg 3

## 0.34.7 (fork-0.34.7) (2023-06-28)

- fix: missing import

## 0.34.6 (fork-0.34.6) (2023-06-27)

- fix: filtering operator `between` was not correctly implemented for SQLAlchemy
  data layer

## 0.34.5 (fork-0.34.5) (2023-02-13)

- fix: filtering operator `between` was not correctly implemented for SQLAlchemy
  data layer

## 0.34.4 (fork-0.34.4) (2023-02-03)

- fix: order of exception converters evaluation is sometimes important: better API error
  responses for uncaught SQLAlchemy exceptions

## 0.34.3 (fork-0.34.3) (2023-02-03)

- feat: reduced amount of logged tracebacks in `ErrorsAsJsonApi`.
  Tracebacks for HTTP statuses `401`, `403` and `405` are logged as `DEBUG`. Other
  errors are still logged as `ERROR`.

## 0.34.2 (fork-0.34.2) (2022-08-28)

- fix: don't force usage of `Flask.g.request_id` if it is not there
  - this shows in error responses as potentially confusing message "X-Request-ID Unknown"

## 0.34.1 (fork-0.34.1) (2022-08-26)

- request `&fields[some_jsonapi_type]=...` should raise `ValueError` instead of generic
  `Exception` when `some_jsonapi_type` is not correct / known

## 0.34.0 (fork-0.34.0) (2022-08-19)

- feat: allow injecting page parameters into `Querystring` instances
  This allows client app to override pagination properties in special cases, while still
  respecting app config everywhere else.
  Example for this: app wants to generate Excel file as response and ignore pagination
  in that request, but still use JSON:API request parsing. In this case, app would
  implement it's own `Resource.get()` method which would mostly the same thing as base
  class one, except it would temporarily disable pagination for given request.

- feat: SQLAlchemy data layer returns `Query` objects instead of lists
  Speeds up large data requests (ie. when application requests JSON:API data but
  disables pagination)

## 0.33.1 (fork-0.33.1) (2022-08-17)

- full indepenedance on which JSON library is used
  - use of custom JSON implementation (ie. `rapidjson`, `simplejson`) is now fully
    controlled by `flask`:
  - we use `flask.json.dumps` everywhere and then the app itself configures what this
    `dumps` call does - uses standard JSON library or custom one

## 0.33.0 (fork-0.33.0) (2022-08-16)

- swithced CI provider, Travis --> GitHub
- supporting Flask only >= 2.2.0
  - Flask dropped metaclasses in favor of `__init_subclass__` (which is great) but
    our `Resource` class relied on metaclasses too
  - supporting both mechanisms, metaclasses and `__init_subclass__`, is not feasible,
    thus dropping support for older flask versions

## 0.32.8 (fork-0.32.8) (2022-02-15)

- fix: PATCH was not rising ValidationError for fields with `required=True`, when those
  fields were missing from `request.body`

## 0.32.7 (fork-0.32.7) (2022-02-15)

- fix: sparse fields were not applied correctly

## 0.32.6 (fork-0.32.6) (2022-03-15)

- feat: added `register_at` parameter to `Api.__init__()`
- fix: `Api` shouldn't use `Flask.config.APLICATION_ROOT` for registering blueprint;
  this variable was not meant for that purpose

## 0.32.5 (fork-0.32.5) (2022-02-16)

- fix: API blueprint should respech `Flask.config.APPLICATION_ROOT`

## 0.32.4 (fork-0.32.4) (2022-02-07)

- fix: more problems with content negotiation: API was allowing different `Accept`
  header, but was still forcing `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` in responses

## 0.32.3 (fork-0.32.3) (2022-02-04)

- fix: marshmallow3 compatibility - `fields.List.container` attribute no longer exists

## 0.32.2 (fork-0.32.2) (2022-01-21)

- fix: API returns 404 on `/resource/<int:id>` routes when no object is found

## 0.32.1 (fork-0.32.1) (2022-01-04)

- feat: allows "multipart/form-data" content type on all POST and PATCH requests
  - this is not ideal, but we need it to support file uploads for some of our APIs
  - in the future, proper content type negotiation must be implemented

## 0.32.0 (fork-0.32.0) (2022-01-03)

- feat: while app exception handling and JSON:API error responses
- feat: use all decorators from all Resource subclasses
- feat: POST and PATCH schemas can be separately declared from `Resource.schema`
- optional call to `model.validate()` in data layer
- support for CSV in simple filter URL parameters (`?filter[foo]=1,2,3`)
- use `rapidjson` if it is installed

## v0.31.2 (2021-12-28)

- initial release based on
  [miLibris/flask-rest-jsonapi](https://github.com/miLibris/flask-rest-jsonapi) `v0.31.2
  (a4ff3f4d5be78071f015efe003e976d31d4eba10)`
